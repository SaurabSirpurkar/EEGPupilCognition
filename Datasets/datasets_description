    Dataset1 : An 18-subject EEG data collection using a visual-oddball task,designed for benchmarking algorithms and headset performance comparisons - Kay Robbins, Kyung-min Su, W. David Hairston
        Subjects viewed images displayed at 2-second intervals and distinguished target oddball images from expected images.
        Several research projects have used this data to test artifact detection, classification, transfer learning, EEG preprocessing, blink detection, and automated annotation algorithms
        EEG: 72 channels, 512Hz
        The data was acquired using a Biosemi Active 2 EEG headset(gel-based) and includes 64 channels of EEG, 4 channels of EOG (electrooculogram), and 2 mastoid reference channels. They also have two processed datasets.
        Cleaning: PREP based noise removal, interpolate bad channels. MARA based artifact removal. Ruinca function was used to calculate ICA components.
        
    Dataset2: Visual Search in Natural Images
        The subject is asked to find a small target in greyscale images of a natural sceneries. Participants were asked to press a button as soon as they detect the target. 1000ms after this, the screen goes blank.
        EEG:25 channels, filtered 1-40Hz
        Eye Data: 500Hz
        
  Our Dataset: Visual oddball task, 11 subjects (9M,2F).
        Subjects 1,2,3,4,5 attended for two sessions.
        EEG: 128 channels, filtered 1-60Hz
        Notch filter: at 50Hz
